 */

/*! \mainpage CBiRRT Openrave Plugin
 *
 *
 * The Constrained BiDirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (cbirrt) plugin contains the cbirrt problem, which parses commands from python or matlab and
 * calls the cbirrt planner. The cbirrt planner is a bidirectional sampling-based rrt which plans
 * on constraint manifolds induced by pose constraints as well as other constraints. This version of the software implements
 * pose constraints as Task Space Region (TSR) Chains. Pose constraints can apply to the start, goal, or entire path.
 * The planner is also set up to work with balance constraints.
